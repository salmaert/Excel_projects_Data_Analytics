## ❓ Objectives  
The analysis focused on four main questions:  
1. Do professionals with more technical skills earn higher salaries?  
2. How do salaries compare between the United States and other countries?  
3. Which technical skills are most frequently required in data-related job postings?  
4. What are the top 10 skills that lead to the highest salaries?
